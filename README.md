# **Bookings Predictor For Bikes**
> A Data Set has been presented to us with information about bike bookings and various associated factors. We are expected to make an ML predictor of future demand so the company can deploy its resources accordingly.

## General Information
<h3><b><u><center>Target</center></u></b></h3>
After surviving the corona associated business crash, the American bike sharing company <b>BoomBikes</b> has hired us to predict forthcoming demand of the bikes to deploy the precious and now diminished resources where the returns can be highest.


<h3><b><u>Required Outcome</u></b></h3>
The company wants to know:
<ol>
    <li><b><i>Variables significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes</i></b></li>
<li><b><i>How well those variables describe the bike demands</i></b></li>
</ol>
<div align="right"><i>let's give them what they want...</i></div>


## Conclusions
Final File Structure,

**1. Bike-Sharing-Abhinav-Tyagi.ipynb**
> Containing Jupyter-Lab With Final Outputs

**2. Bike-Sharing-Abhinav-Tyagi.py**
> Final Jupyter-Lab Notebook Converted to machine executable Python Script.

**3. Datasets**
> loan.csv is in dataset/ directory
